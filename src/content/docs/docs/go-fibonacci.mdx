## Description
The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.

This simple library is to calculate Fibonacci numbers up to a given limit. It allows you to compute various characteristics like highest prime factor, parity, and more.

## Installation
```bash
go get go.mcds.moe/fibonacci
```

## Usage
```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "go.mcds.moe/fibonacci"
)

func main() {
    // Calculates the 5th Fibonacci number recursively
    fmt.Println(fibonacci.Fib(5))

    // Calculates the 10th Fibonacci number iteratively
    fmt.Println(fibonacci.FibIt(10))

    // Calculates the 25th Fibonacci number using multiple worker threads
    fmt.Println(fibonacci.FibMultithreaded(25))
}
```
